				<h3>Players' Equipment</h3>
				<p>Players must wear footwear, and must not wear anything
					dangerous to any other player. Shinguards are recommended, but if
					worn, must be wholly covered by socks.</p>
				<h3>Players, Substitutes, and Decisions</h3>
				<p>Teams consist of four players, one of whom is the goalkeeper,
					plus up to two additional substitutes.</p>
				<p>Substitutions can be made at any time, provided that the ball
					is five metres away and the player entering enters where the player
					exiting exits. If a team has only three players able to play, the
					other team must reduce to three. If a team has less than three
					players able to play, the match is forfeited.</p>
				<p>Goalkeeper changes must occur either:
				<p>
				<ul>
					<li>when the ball is out of play at half time, or for a
						restart to be taken by the team making the change; or</li>
					<li>by performing a regular substitution with a substitute
						wearing goalkeeper colours, regardless of whether the ball is in
						or out of play.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>As there are no referees, players call infringements and ball
					out of play. The captain's decision on whether a call is made,
					contested or withdrawn by their team is final. Contested restarts
					result in a goal line restart (goal clearance or goal kick) to the
					team whose half the ball was in. If a call is made that results in
					play being stopped, and is then withdrawn by the team making the
					call, the team the call was made against receives a free kick from
					where the ball was located when play was stopped. Teams are
					encouraged to play in a sporting manner by:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>immediately conceding a restart when they are aware they
						or a teammate have committed an offence or the ball has gone out
						of play off them; and</li>
					<li>only calling outs off the opposition if they are
						completely certain and infringements by the opposition if it is
						either blatant or has an obvious impact on the game.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>The Length of the Match and The Ball In Play</h3>
				<p>The duration of each match is 40 minutes, consisting of two
					20 minute periods. Teams may mutually agree to shorten the playing
					time before the start of the match, down to a minimum of 30
					minutes, provided that both playing periods remain equal in length.
				</p>
				<p>The ball is only considered to have crossed a line only if
					the whole ball has passed over the line, ie. none of the ball is
					overhanging the line.</p>
				<h3>Restarts of Play</h3>
				<p>If the ball crosses a touch line, the opponents of the team
					who last touched the ball take a touch line restart - their choice
					of either a kick-in or throw-in. For the goal line, if last touched
					by the attacking team, the opponents take a goal line restart -
					their choice of either a goal clearance or goal kick, otherwise, if
					last touched by the defending team, the opponents take a corner
					kick.</p>
				<p>Throw-ins are taken with part of both feet grounded either on
					or behind the line, with both hands, with at least part of the ball
					starting behind an imaginary vertical line continuing upwards from
					the centre of the top of the player's head. The ball must not stop
					moving once it starts being thrown until it is released eg.
					stopping the ball in front of the chest and then dropping it or
					pushing it is an infringement of the throw-in procedure.</p>
				<p>Kick-ins are taken with part of the ball on or behind the
					line. Goal clearances are taken by the goalkeeper throwing the ball
					from within their goal area. Goal kicks are taken from any point
					within the goal area.</p>
				<p>Kick-offs (taken at the start of each period, and after a
					goal is scored) must be kicked forwards.</p>
				<p>Any infringement of a restart procedure results in a retake
					by the same team.</p>
				<p>All restarts are direct ie. players can score against
					opponents on any restart without it first touching another player,
					but not against themselves.</p>
				<h3>Fouls, Misconduct and Other Infringements</h3>
				<p>Goalkeeper infringements (handling a ball deliberately kicked
					or thrown to the goalkeeper by a teammate, handling the ball after
					having possession with feet or hands for more than ten seconds)
					result in a free kick awarded on the goal area line, closest to
					where the infringement occurred.</p>
				<p>Double-touch infringements (playing the ball a second time
					after taking a restart, before it touches an opponent or goes out
					of play) result in a free kick awarded to the opponents from where
					the ball was touched a second time.</p>
				<p>Free kicks are awarded for fouls - ie. any unfair contact
					(any contact that impacts ability to move or play the ball other
					than a fair charge), dangerous play, deliberate handling, impeding,
					challenging the goalkeeper when they have possession of (ie. the
					ball held between part of at least one hand/arm and any other
					surface) or are releasing the ball.</p>
				<p>Fair charges involve side to side contact, with at least one
					of the charger or the player being charged within playing distance
					of the ball. The charge must be made whilst moving towards the
					ball, and involve no active use of the arm.</p>
				<p>It is only an offence to deliberately handle the ball (except
					for the goalkeeper within their penalty area). "Deliberately
					handling" means either moving the hand or arm towards the ball or
					flight path of the ball, leaving the hand or arm in the flight path
					of the ball when there is ample time to move it, or placing the
					hand or arm in an unreasonable position, with the ball contacting
					the hand or arm. Unintentional handling is not an offence, even if
					the player who handled the ball gained a significant advantage.</p>
				<p>Free kicks for fouls are taken from wherever the offence
					occurred, even if they occur inside the goal area. Penalty kicks
					are awarded for denial of an obvious goalscoring opportunity by a
					foul / misconduct. Denial of a certain goal by a foul / misconduct
					results in a goal considered to have been scored and a kick-off to
					the conceding team.</p>
				<p>Players must retreat at least five metres from any opponents'
					restart until the ball is in play. Players must also retreat five
					metres from the goalkeeper when they are holding the ball.</p>
				<p>Free kicks awarded to the defending team inside their own
					goal area are taken as a goal line restart instead.</p>

				<p>Wins result in 3 competition points, draws result in 1 point,
					and losses result in 0 points.</p>
				<p>When a team forfeits, a 5 - 0 score is recorded in favour of
					the other team (unless the team forfeiting is losing by more than
					five goals at the time of the forfeit, in which case, that score is
					recorded instead). The other team will receive three competition
					points, and the forfeiting team will receive zero.</p>
				<p>If both teams forfeit the result is recorded as 0 - 0, with
					both teams receiving zero competition points.</p>
				<p>Playing any ineligible player results in a forfeit.</p>
				<p>Captains of teams must report the score and names of scorers
					to the Competition Administrator upon completion of each match.</p>
				<p>Captains of teams must also provide the Competition
					Administrator with the names of which opponents will receive three
					votes, two votes and one vote respectively towards Golden Ball
					(player of the tournament) upon completion of each match.</p>
				<p>If a match is abandoned for any other reason, or any
					disciplinary issues occur, they are handled at the discretion of
					the Competition Administrator.</p>
